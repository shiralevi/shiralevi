## 🚀 About Me

[cite_start]I am a creative Full Stack Developer with a passion for problem-solving and a "think outside the box" mentality[cite: 1, 4]. I am sharp, thorough, and possess a broad perspective on software architecture. [cite_start]I love challenges and have extensive experience in building complex, scalable systems using advanced technologies[cite: 4, 5].

For me, programming is much more than writing code—it's about the thrill of tackling logic puzzles and creating meaningful digital experiences. [cite_start]I have a high capacity for fast self-learning and I truly enjoy the process of diving into new frameworks and finding innovative solutions[cite: 5]. [cite_start]Whether working independently or as part of a professional team, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality, efficient, and user-centric applications[cite: 5, 6].
