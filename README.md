## 🚀 About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer with a creative mindset and a "think outside the box" approach. I am sharp, thorough, and possess a broad perspective on software architecture. I love challenges and I am a fast self-learner, capable of integrating into teams and working independently on complex projects.

My background includes a **Software Engineering degree (MAHAT)** and intensive training in the **KamaTech Ultra Code** program. I have practical experience from my internship at **iAngels**, where I worked on high-scale systems managing hundreds of millions of dollars.
